  "Background:"\
  "On the one year anniversary of the deadly attack on Isreal, Bashar al-Assad launches a series of chemical attacks across Southern Greece, targeting highly Christian population and NATO infrastructures.

  ""\
  "Current:"\
  "NATO has since captured most of Syria in the 3 day operation and a USMC company has just taken Damascus airport denying Assad his desperate escape. Intelligence suggests that Assad and his sons have fortified themselves within two key locations in Southern Syria: a walled mosque compound and his private mansion estate on the outskirts near the boarder of Jordan. Both locations are believed to house key figures in Assad’s lineage and regime leadership. "\
  ""\
  "Task:"\
  "The USMC platoon is tasked with eliminating Assad and his sons, ending the conflict and finally bring peace to Syria."
