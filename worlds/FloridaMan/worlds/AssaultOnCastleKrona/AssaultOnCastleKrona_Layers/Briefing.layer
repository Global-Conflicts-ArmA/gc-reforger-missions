  "Russian Federation Armed Forces have located Castle Krona after a CDF raid on a nearby Russian military installation. Two platoons of Russian infantry are currently staged at the Russian RP Point, approximately 1km south of the objective. Intelligence reports suggest they are not bringing their BTRs past the RP point. Enemy forces are expected to initiate a coordinated ground assault on the castle within the next 60 minutes. "\

  "CDF forces successfully executed a raid on a Russian forward operating base 12 hours ago, seizing critical supplies and classified materials. Defensive forces have since withdrawn and regrouped at Castle Krona. No reinforcements are currently available; the castle must be held until further notice. "\
