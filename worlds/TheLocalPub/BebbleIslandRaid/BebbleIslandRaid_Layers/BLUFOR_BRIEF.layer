  "One of the first things the Agrentine Army did when making land fall on the Falkland islands was capture Bebble Island."\
  "Situated on the north west of the falkland mainland, Bebble island was the closest location to Argentina within the Falklands that provided airfields, ports, supplies, all within a defendable location. It was a key target for the invaders."\

  "The Falkland islands were home to British civilians, some of who were part of military families living on the island. While the soldiers are now POWs, the island civilian populas has been kept to not only deter kinetic offensive actions from the British to retake the island, but to also help maintain the island facilities."\
  ""\
  "1 month into the invasion of the Falkland islands, the top brass have come up with a plan to conduct a shaping operation by the special boat service (SBS) in order to set the state for follow on forces to recapture the island."\
