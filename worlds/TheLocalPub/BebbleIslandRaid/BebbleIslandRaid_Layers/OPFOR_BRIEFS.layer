  ""\
  "One of the first things the Agrentine Army did when making land fall on the Falkland islands was capture Bebble Island."\
  "Situated on the north west of the falkland mainland, Bebble island was the closest location to Argentina within the Falklands that provided airfields, ports, supplies, all within a defendable location. It was a key target for the invaders."\
  "The British forces garrisoning Bebble island stood no chance. Completely out numbered 10-1, out gunned, and with no other options, the British garrison surrendered and were taken as POWs."\
  "The Falkland islands were home to British civilians, some of who were part of military families living on the island. While the soldiers are now POWs, the island civilian populas has been kept to not only deter kinetic offensive actions from the British to retake the island, but to also help maintain the island facilities."\
  ""\
  "Now after securing the island, our company has gone into routine."\
  "Conducting security operations so that the airforce can work from the air base we have here."
